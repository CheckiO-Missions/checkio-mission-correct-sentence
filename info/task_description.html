<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>
    For the input of your function, you will be given one sentence. You have to return a corrected version, that starts with a capital letter and ends with a period (dot). 
</p>

<p><i>Pay attention to the fact that not all of the fixes are necessary. If a sentence already ends with a period (dot), then adding another one will be a mistake.</i></p>
